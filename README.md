<h3 id="learned">What I learned</h3>

For this project I learned how to use CSS hover and overlay properties. One will notice that when the cube image is hovered it's appearance changes. That part of styling I will say was the most difficult for me, but after some research I finally put together the code which gave me that look and thus my introduction to Positioning in CSS.

### Continued development

As I mentioned in the [What I learned](#learned) section, this project introduced me to Positioning in CSS. In as much as my learning of HTML & CSS is ongoing Positioning is going to be included in my *to learn list*.
